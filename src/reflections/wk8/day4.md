Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions
<br>
<br>

Q1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
<br>
  Unit Testing
  Component Testing
  End-To-End (E2E) Testing
<br>
<br>

Q2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
<br>
 E2E seems the most useful, its kind of like testing the app as a whole like if it were deployed, rather than only testing chunks of it at a time.
<br>
<br>

Q3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
<br>
I feel like they are all useful, so its hard to say which one is least. Maybe component testing is a little less useful than unit testing, though they seem pretty similar, rather than small chunks of code you are testing components themselves. I'd probably go with component testing as the least useful.
