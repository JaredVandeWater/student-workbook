Q2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
<br>
 Without it, a developer can't be totally sure that his code is working as intended. Leaving it up to QA might work, but it doesn't give the programmer peace of mind when they change something because QA is usually top level, only the programmers truly know whats going on under the hood.
