Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small Teams and answer the following questions
<br>
<br>

Q1. Why is communication on a small team important?
<br>
 Without keeping on the same page, a project can kind of dive into chaos, people will step on each others code and no one will know where things are at.
<br>
<br>

Q2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
<br>
 Basically you need to break apart tasks a little bit more, and have more people doing more things but keeping a balance of how much effort and work output to people. It really depends on the team though, you can go by the book or use a hybrid approach.
<br>
<br>

Q3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
<br>

  Good service Fast won't be Cheap

  Fast service Cheap won't be Good
