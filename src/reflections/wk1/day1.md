## Daily Journal and Questions
Today I learned what an "md" (markdown) file is, and I answered some questions about github.

## In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git allows us to take a snapshot of our program. This snapshot can be saved into cloud servers like github or gitlab, leaving a trail of progress on your program. This way you can access older versions of your program to better help find issues that may have been implemented into the latest version, or simply to start from an earlier point.

This is also used with teams, as git allows multiple developers access saved code and commit their own changes. Version control is incredibly useful due to the complexity and how much a program can change over time.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Using separate branches allows multiple developers to create and commit changes without affecting one another. Then when one developer is done they can merge them together into the master branch. It makes it easier for developers to not step on one another.

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is the act of taking a snapshot of your code, while github is a cloud based system that can save those snapshots and leave a trail of the development of your program.

### Question I thought of ~ why did we use a Source directory before the codeworks one?
