## Daily Journal and Questions
Wow, css is tricky, very fun to mess with, but man I am slow at figuring out. Hoping to get faster.

What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A Pseudo-Class is what programmers use to give classes special states. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXKwDGtjGE) summed them up quite nicely.

I think the most interesting Pseudo-Class is the hover class, as I love making things change with a mouse-over, I think I will use it the most often.

What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity chooses the order in which a rule is applied to an element. It's useful whenever you need to be sure an element has a certain property over a different one, it's up to the programmer to figure out how to override it.

What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

When another Dev tries to fix old code, it may be difficult to figure out why a certain element isn't changing like it's supposed to, there may be !importants messing with the order. Having multiple !importants also makes for confusing code.

One Question I had was why use the bold tag over font weight in css?
