## Daily Journal and Questions
Working with a team member was better than expected, while I'm still very slow at web dev, I feel like bouncing skill off someone made the process less painful. Like there was a lot less down time and getting stuck.

What is the purpose of wire-framing?

In basic terms, a wireframe is a blueprint for a website, its mostly used to get a picture of what the user experience will be like for the site before actually spending time developing.

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low fidelity wire frames can be as simple a sketch made in a meeting, these a great for getting the ball rolling on a project or making a quick decision on the direction of a site.

mid fidelity is a better laid out wireframe containing more detailed features without the distractions of images, and fancy typography.

high fidelity wireframes are basically pixel perfect renditions of an expected project. These a great for drawing out complex functions of the site, and seeing how they will look.

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

When building for clients and companies, these are absolutely worth the effort, I think the type you make really depends on the difficulty of the functionality, but using  at least mid fidelity wireframes are clearly going to save effort in the long run.
