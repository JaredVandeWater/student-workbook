## Daily Journal and Questions
Struggling more than I expected with bootstrap, gonna power through it.
<br>
<br>

<br>
1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
<br> <br>
My favorite tip listed in the reading was using alternatives to borders. I like that adding some space, or a different background color can make a muc.h smoother transition.
<br>
<br>
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
<br>
<br>
    Honestly the most helpful so far has simply been the blog that was put together for cheating at design.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
<br>
<br>
I think security is a big thing that people assume when visiting a site, if your site looks clustered with bad design, people are much less likely to use your services. I know that I would never enter my credit card into a site that looked sketchy and outdated.
