## Daily Journal and Questions
<br>
That was a busy week, I didn't think I could get the project done at first, with me being in vegas and all, but It really started coming together.

I don't think I could have done it without the postman tests, I would have been incredibly lost, and they really kept me on track.

In total it took me around 50 hours, I stayed up late a couple nights due to things breaking, but on thursday, with a little help from the TAs, I was able to get it done.

Fun project, I would say I prefer working in a team setting, as doing something this large completely solo can be pretty tricky.
