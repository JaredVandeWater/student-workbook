## Daily Journal and Questions
<br>
<br>
Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions

<br>
<br>

Q1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
<br>
Value Types - something that holds data within it's own value type.
Reference Types - Instead of storing it's data directly, it stores it in a random place in memory.
Pointer Types - These are simply a memory location where data is stored.
<br>
<br>

Q2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
<br>
bool
 byte
 char
 decimal
 double
 enum
 float
 int
 long
 sbyte
 short
 struct
 uint
 ulong
 ushort

 There are quite a lot more number types, and C# uses char when it's a single letter.
<br>
<br>

Q3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
<br>
Reference types have their data sent to a random point in memory, where value types are stored in their own memory spaces, inside of the variables themselves.
