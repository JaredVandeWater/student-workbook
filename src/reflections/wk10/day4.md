## Daily Journal and Questions
<br>
<br>
Read Foundations of C# > C# Enum's and answer the following questions
<br>
<br>

Q1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
<br>
They seem to be used to store integers as names, and they make for easy comparison. 
It looks like its mostly for readability.
<br>
<br>

Q2. How can you modify an Enum?
<br>
Will update after lecture when I have a better understanding.
<br>
<br>

Q3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
<br>
I've not used any yet, I'm not totally sure how I could at the moment, maybe after the lecture on enums I'll have a better grasp
