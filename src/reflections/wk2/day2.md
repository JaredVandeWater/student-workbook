<br>
What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
<br>
Declaration, expression, and Arrow functions. Main difference is that expressions define a function without a name and is not hoisted, and the arrow functions are just shorter syntax that don't create a 'this' value.
<br><br>
<br>

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
<br>
<br>
Parameters are what ask for arguments before a function is called, whereas he arguments are what are actually passed through.
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
<br>
When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function.
<br>
This would include things like map or filter.
