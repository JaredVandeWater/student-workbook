# Intro to JavaScript

**1.** Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Var, Let, and Const
```
**2.** What is the definition of a function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Function is a subprogram that does mini tasks for you. They always return a value.
```
**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single Responsibility
Open-closed principle (open for extension, closed for modification)
Liskov substitution principle (objects should be replaceable without messing up the rest of the program)
Interface segregation principle (never force a client to have an interface they don't use, or depend on methods they don't use.)
Dependency inversion principle (High level modules don't depend on a low level module.)
```
**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
2, because arrays are zero indexed.
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
you.friends.push(them)
```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
if (a<10){
  b=0
}
```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
initializer, condition, then the blank one is final-expression.
```
**8.** What does the `DOM` acronym stand for? Which file is first accessed to render the `DOM`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Data Object Model -  first file is html.
```

**9.** What are the `9` ECMAScript types as defined by MDN?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
primitive---
undefined
boolean
number
string
bigint
symbol

structural--
object
function

structural root--
null
```
**10.** When it comes to functions or methods, what is the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Parameters are what ask for arguments before a function is called, whereas he arguments are what are actually passed through.
```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
primitive value is simply saved in memory as itself.

reference values are compared by their reference, they can have the same value but be stored in different places in memory.
