<br>

Q1. What is a virtual property?
<br>
It's a way to add a property without having to add another property to our database, like how we could have first and last name, and we could just use that info to get their full name.
<br>
<br>

Q2. When might you use a virtual property?
<br>
It seems like the most common is simply to get th full name or maybe the initials of a user.
<br>
<br>

Q3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?
<br>
 Unfortunately you cannot query the database using virtual properties, I could be wrong, butI think youcan set a non virtual property with a virtual property functions value, then you could search by it. I'm a bit shaky on this concept at the moment though.
