Read Servers with Node/Express > Using Query Parameters and answer the following questions
<br>
<br>

Q1. What is the purpose of a Query String?
<br>
Query strings allow us to pass info to and from a website by appending info to the end of a url.
<br>
<br>

Q2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
<br>
Start out with a '?' then you look for a key that equals a value. Unfortunatly your only comparson can be an equals, but you can add more parametors and narrow it down with a '&'
<br>
<br>

Q3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
<br>
When you have different filters that a user can select, you could simply add each filter as a query parameter to only show items in a database that match those filters.
