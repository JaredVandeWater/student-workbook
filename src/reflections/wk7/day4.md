## Daily Journal and Questions
<br>
<br>
Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions
<br>
<br>

Q1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
<br>
 We definitely planned out what we wanted to do and build the backend together. This helped us all understand what was going ona bit better, but honestly we could have prepped even more.
<br>
<br>

Q2. What went well?
<br>
My team was fun and pretty chill, I was able to get a lot done on my section since it was a bit more separated from the other sections.
<br>
<br>

Q3. What would you do differently?
<br>
Plan a bit more, we got caught up on some small stuff, and I think a more high fidelity figma would have helped with making decisions in the later half of the project.
