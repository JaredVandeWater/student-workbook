Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > How to use Props in Vue and answer the following questions

<br>
<br>

Q1. What are props?
<br>
Similar to how we pass arguments into functions, props are how we pass data around to different components.
<br>
<br>

Q2. What are props used for?
<br>
They are how we make our components so reusable, since a component is kind of used like an html element, the props are like the bonus info that that element can use, allowing that element to be completely customizable depending on what you need and where. 
<br>
<br>

Q3. Where can props be used or accessed?
<br>
Props are created on the component and accessed in the sort of html element of that component.
