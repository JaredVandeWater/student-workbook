Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Using Nested Routes in Vue.js and answer the following questions
<br>
<br>

Q1. What is a nested route?
<br>
Its a way to have subpages within main pages, and you can even have multiple on the same page, or even put subpages in your subpages. 
<br>
<br>

Q2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
<br>
This is useful with either static or dynamic pages, like clicking a pokemon and getting sent to that specific pokemons ID page, or simply having pokemon separated by their types, so you'd have pokemon/water/squirtle, or any other amount of pokemon
<br>
<br>

Q3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
<br>
Yes, you can even pass a whole object, you can use this info by using useRoute, this is good whenever you have a service function that needs params from the thing you clicked on to get to the page.
