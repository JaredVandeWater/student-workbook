<br>

Q1. What is Component based architecture?
<br>
It's breaking up different sections of a front end into reusable, encapsulated features.
<br>
<br>

Q2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
<br>
The DOM can update without a page refresh, components are reusable and extendable, everything is encapsulated so if something breaks its easy to find. There are quite a lot of benefits. 
<br>
<br>

Q3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
<br>
Using many components might cause your code to become bloated, and some people use components for every single piece of UI on their site, rather than using it when it is needed as intended.
