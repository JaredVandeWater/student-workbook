Q1. Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

Codeworks was awesome, I never thought I could learn as much as I did, and I can't thank you guys enough. You were accommodating and treated everyone like friends and family. You all clearly care a lot about what you do, and I've never experienced that before in a learning environment. I think the checkpoints were fun and interesting, the way things were taught made sense to me, and  I never felt embarrassed to ask stupid questions. I think I made a lot of friends here, and I'm super excited to see where everyone goes and keep in touch with people. More places need to take a page out of your playbook because seriously, 5 years of college had nothing on this. Keep doing what you do!
