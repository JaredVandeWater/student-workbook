Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions
<br>
<br>

What is the purpose of Async/Await?
<br>
These help make the promise system easier. The async will call a promise function, and using await before it will make the calling code stop until the promise is resolved or rejected.
<br>
<br>

What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
<br>
You must put the function as async, and put await before the function runs to utilize a server. 
<br>
<br>

What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
<br>
Using Async code allows a function to do something in the background while other functions run, and continue when it has retrieved what it was looking for.
