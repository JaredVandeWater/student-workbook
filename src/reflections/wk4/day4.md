Read Asynchronous Code > What is REST and answer the following questions
<br>
<br>

What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
<br>
REpresentational State Transfer - It means a server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource. 
<br>
<br>

What does Stateless mean?
<br>
The server doesn't remember who made requests, it just delivers a response regardless of other requests made by the same user.
<br>
<br>

What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
<br>
We end each section with a plural, such as questions, leaving an array of questions, then often you'd do questions/1 to grab the first, or possible the questions/question-id to grab a specific question based on its id.
